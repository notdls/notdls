### 😷 About me
Sup, I'm dls, currently working as an offensive security consultant at ~~redacted~~. I am a massive web nerd with a data collection addiction, love breaking things apart as well as ~~building~~ over-engineering things.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [known breaches](https://breaches.dls.sh/), a searchable collection of known databreaches indexed by databreach search engines and aggregators, including Dehashed.com, Leak-Lookup.com, HaveIBeenPwned.com and Vigilante.pw. 
- 💬 Ask me about web application security, recon, OSINT, databreaches.
